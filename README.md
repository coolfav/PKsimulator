# PKsimulator
created by coolfav

This is a barebones pokemon simulator made in Java. It includes damage calculation using the fomula from the real game, including supereffectiveness, not every effectiveness, and misses. The physical/special split is also present. Critical hits have not been fully implemented.

As stated before, this simulator is barebones. Pokemon sprites, stats, moves, and types are all generated randomly. All moves have the same base power of 80 and hit rate of 95, although they have different types and may be either physical or special. Power Points are not implemented.

To run the program, simply compile and run "themain2.java". 

To control the game, simply use your keyboard's arrow keys and the enter button.

This was made for fun as a little project, anyone is free to use, modify or distribute the code. Credit is appreciated but not required.
